# Dual Licensing Approach for ESPÆCIAL's Coordinate Transformation Tools
This repository provides open-source coordinate transformation tools developed by ESPÆCIAL. We believe in making these tools accessible to everyone, while also offering a commercial licensing option for organizations seeking additional benefits.

## Licensing Options:

We offer two licensing options for these coordinate transformation tools:

- MIT License: This permissive license allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the code for any purpose, including commercial projects. You are required to include the MIT License file in your distributed copies. (See LICENSE-MIT for details.)
- Commercial License Agreement: This agreement provides extended rights and support for commercial users. It allows you to use the tools in closed-source commercial applications, while acknowledging ESPÆCIAL's contribution. We offer various support options and potential customization based on your specific needs. (See LICENSE-Commercial for details.)

## Choosing the Right License:

The appropriate license for you depends on the nature and scope of your project:
- Small Projects or Individual Use: If you are working on a small project or using the tools for personal use, the MIT License is the most suitable option.
- Commercial Projects: For larger organizations or projects with commercial intent, we recommend considering the Commercial License Agreement. It offers benefits such as:
  - Access to additional support services.
  - Potential customization options for the tools.
  - Defined terms for commercial use and attribution.

## How to Apply a License:

To use the code under the MIT License, simply include the LICENSE-MIT file in your project repository. For the Commercial License Agreement, please contact us at nicalcoca@gmail.com to discuss your specific needs and obtain a license agreement.

## Transparency and Communication:

We are committed to transparency in our licensing approach. If you have any questions about these licenses or need help choosing the right one for your project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

We appreciate your interest in our coordinate transformation tools!
